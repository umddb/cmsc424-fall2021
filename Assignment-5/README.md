# Assignment 5: Apache Spark and MongoDB

Assignment 11 focuses on two modern NoSQL systems: 
(1) Apache Spark for doing large-scale data analysis tasks: for this assignment, we will use relatively small datasets and  we won't run anything in distributed mode; however Spark can be easily used to run the same programs on much larger datasets.
(2) MongoDB.

## Part 1: Apache Spark 

### Getting Started with Spark

This guide is basically a summary of the excellent tutorials that can be found at the [Spark website](http://spark.apache.org).

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org) is a relatively new cluster computing framework, developed originally at UC Berkeley. It significantly generalizes the 2-stage Map-Reduce paradigm (originally proposed by Google and popularized by open-source Hadoop system); Spark is instead based on the abstraction of **resilient distributed datasets (RDDs)**. An RDD is basically a distributed collection of items, that can be created in a variety of ways. Spark provides a set of operations to transform one or more RDDs into an output RDD, and analysis tasks are written as chains of these operations.

Spark can be used with the Hadoop ecosystem, including the HDFS file system and the YARN resource manager. 

### Installing Spark

As before, we have modified the VagrantFile in the top-level directory directory. Since the Spark distribution is large, we ask you to download that directly from the Spark website.

1. Download the Spark package at http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html. We will use **Version 3.2.0, Pre-built for Hadoop 3.3 or later**.
2. Move the downloaded file to the `Assignment-5/` directory (so it is available in '/vagrant' on the virtual machine, or '/data' if you are using Dockerfile), and uncompress it using: 
`tar zxvf spark-3.2.0-bin-hadoop3.2.tgz`
3. This will create a -new directory: `spark-3.2.0-bin-hadoop3.2/`. 
4. Set the SPARKHOME variable: `export SPARKHOME=/vagrant/spark-3.2.0-bin-hadoop3.2/` (modify appropriately if it is downloaded somewhere else).

We are ready to use Spark. 

### Spark and Python

Spark primarily supports three languages: Scala (Spark is written in Scala), Java, and Python. We will use Python here -- you can follow the instructions at the tutorial
and quick start (http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html) for other languages. The Java equivalent code can be very verbose and hard to follow. The below
shows a way to use the Python interface through the standard Python shell.

### Jupyter Notebook

To use Spark within the Jupyter Notebook (and to play with the Notebook we have provided), you can do (from the `/vagrant` directory on the VM, or ):
	```
	PYSPARK_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3 PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON="jupyter" PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS="notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8881" $SPARKHOME/bin/pyspark
	```
For Docker, use: 
	```
	PYSPARK_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3 PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON="jupyter" PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS="notebook --allow-root --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8881" $SPARKHOME/bin/pyspark
	```
You need to make sure you are mapping the port 8881 for this to work.

### PySpark Shell

You can also use the PySpark Shell directly.

1. `$SPARKHOME/bin/pyspark`: This will start a Python shell (it will also output a bunch of stuff about what Spark is doing). The relevant variables are initialized in this python
shell, but otherwise it is just a standard Python shell.

2. `>>> textFile = sc.textFile("README.md")`: This creates a new RDD, called `textFile`, by reading data from a local file. The `sc.textFile` commands create an RDD
containing one entry per line in the file.

3. You can see some information about the RDD by doing `textFile.count()` or `textFile.first()`, or `textFile.take(5)` (which prints an array containing 5 items from the RDD).

4. We recommend you follow the rest of the commands in the quick start guide (http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html). Here we will simply do the Word Count
application.

#### Word Count Application

The following command (in the pyspark shell) does a word count, i.e., it counts the number of times each word appears in the file `README.md`. Use `counts.take(5)` to see the output.

`>>> counts = textFile.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" ")).map(lambda word: (word, 1)).reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)`

Here is the same code without the use of `lambda` functions.

```
def split(line): 
    return line.split(" ")
def generateone(word): 
    return (word, 1)
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b

textfile.flatMap(split).map(generateone).reduceByKey(sum)
```

The `flatmap` splits each line into words, and the following `map` and `reduce` do the counting (we will discuss this in the class, but here is an excellent and detailed
description: [Hadoop Map-Reduce Tutorial](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/mapred_tutorial.html#Source+Code) (look for Walk-Through).

The `lambda` representation is more compact and preferable, especially for small functions, but for large functions, it is better to separate out the definitions.

### Running it as an Application

Instead of using a shell, you can also write your code as a python file, and *submit* that to the spark cluster. The `project5` directory contains a python file `wordcount.py`,
which runs the program in a local mode. To run the program, do:
`$SPARKHOME/bin/spark-submit wordcount.py`

### More...

We encourage you to look at the [Spark Programming Guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html) and play with the other RDD manipulation commands. 
You should also try out the Scala and Java interfaces.

### Assignment Details

We have provided a Python file: `assignment.py`, that initializes the folllowing RDDs:
* An RDD consisting of lines from a Shakespeare play (`play.txt`)
* An RDD consisting of lines from a log file (`NASA_logs_sample.txt`)
* An RDD consisting of 2-tuples indicating user-product ratings from Amazon Dataset (`amazon-ratings.txt`)
* An RDD consisting of JSON documents pertaining to all the Noble Laureates over last few years (`prize.json`)

The file also contains some examples of operations on these RDDs. 

Your tasks are to fill out the 8 functions that are defined in the `functions.py` file (starting with `task`). The amount of code that you 
write would typically be small (several would be one-liners), with the exception of the last one. 

First 8 tasks are worth 0.25 points each, and the remaining 2 are worth 0.5 points each.

- **Task 1**: Write the function that takes as input the `amazonInputRDD` (which is an RDD of lines) and
`maps` each line to a tuple while removing the initial descriptor, i.e., the first line "user1 product1 5.0" gets mapped to a tuple `(1, 1, 5.0)`. This just requires a single `map`.

- **Task 2**: Complete the function that takes as input the `amazonInputRDD` and computes the
average rating for each user across all the products they reviewed. 
The output should be an RDD of 2-tuples of the form `(user1, 2.87)` (not the correct answer).
You can either use `aggregateByKey` or a `reduceByKey` followed by a `map`.

- **Task 3**: Complete the function that takes as input the `amazonInputRDD` and computes the
`mode` rating for each product across all users (i.e., the rating that was most common for that
product). If there are ties, pick the higher rating. Easiest way to do this would be a
`groupByKey` followed by a map to compute the `mode`.

- **Task 4**: For `logsRDD`, write a function that computes the number of log requests for each year. So the output should be an RDD with records of
teh form `(1995, 2952)` (not the correct answer). This can be done through a `map` to extract the years, followed by a group by aggregate.

- **Task 5**: Write just the flatmap function `task5_flatmap` that operates on `playRDD` -- for each line, it outputs the individual words sanitized
to remove any non-alphanumerical characters. So for the 3rd line, it would output a list: `[Enter, LEONATO, HERO, and, BEATRICE, with, a, Messenger]`.

- **Task 6**: This takes as input the playRDD and for each line, finds the first word in the line, and also counts the number of words. It should then filter the RDD by only selecting the lines where the count of words in the line is > 10. The output will be an RDD where the key is the first word in the line, and the value is a 2-tuple, the first being the line and the second being the number of words (which must be >10). Simplest way to do it is probably a `map` followed by a `filter`.

- **Task 7**: Write just the flatmap function (`task7_flatmap`) that takes in a parsed JSON document (from `prize.json`) and returns the surnames of the Nobel Laureates. In other words, the following command should create an RDD with all the surnames. We will use `json.loads` to parse the JSONs (this is already done). Make sure to look at what it returns so you know how to access the information inside the parsed JSONs (these are basically nested dictionaries). (https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html)
```
     	task7_result = nobelRDD.map(json.loads).flatMap(task2_flatmap)
```

- **Task 8**: Write a sequence of transformations starting from prizeRDD that returns an PairRDD where the key is the `category` (`physics` etc), and the value is a list of all Nobel Laureates for that category (just their surnames). Make sure the final values are `list`s, and not some other class objects (if you do a `take(5)`, it should print out the lists).

- **Task 9**: This function operates on the `logsRDD`. It takes as input a list of *dates* and returns an RDD with "hosts" that were present in the log on all of 
those dates. The dates would be provided as strings, in the same format that they appear in the logs (e.g., '01/Jul/1995' and '02/Jul/1995').
The format of the log entries should be self-explanatory, but here are more details if you need: [NASA Logs](http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/NASA-HTTP.html)
Try to minimize the number of RDDs you end up creating.

- **Task 10**: Complete a function to calculate the degree distribution of user nodes in the Amazon graph (i.e., `amazonBipartiteRDD`). In other words, calculate the degree of each user node (i.e., number of products each user has rated), and then use a reduceByKey (or aggregateByKey) to find the number of nodes with a given degree. The output should be a PairRDD where the key is the degree, and the value is the number of nodes in the graph with that degree.

### Sample results.txt File
You can use spark-submit to run the `assignment.py` file, but it would be easier to develop with `pyspark` (by copying the commands over). 

**results.txt** shows the results of running assignment.py on our code using: `$SPARKHOME/bin/spark-submit assignment.py`


## Part 2: MongoDB
MongoDB is a database system, just like PostgreSQL, but has a different data model (JSON) and a different query language.

### Installation
The provided Vagrantfile and Dockerfile (in the top-level directory) install MongoDB, and `pymongo`, the driver to use MongoDB from within Python.

**NOTE: Queries written using pymongo look slightly different from queries written directly in the `mongo` shell.**

### Dataset
We are using one of the test datasets provided by MongoDB itself, called `sample-analytics`. It has three collections:
1. `customers`: Each document corresponds to a customer, and has basic information about the customer, as well as some information about the benefits they have. It also contains an array of `accounts` for that customer.
1. `accounts`: Each document contains information for an account, mainly which types of products it allows using.
1. `transactions`: Each document contains the transactions for a given account -- each transaction being a stock trade.

You can see the raw JSONs (in MongoDB export format) in `sample_analytics` directory.

### Assignment
As with the SQL assignment, the actual tasks are provided in the `queries.py` file. You should fill out your answers in that file. You can use `python3 MongoDBTesting.py` to run all the queries and see the results. 

**The assignment is not fully released yet. We will update the `queries.py` file with more details in the next day, but you can get started on the first 7 queries.**

## Submission
Submit the `functions.py` file for Apache Spark part, and `queries.py` for MongoDB part.
